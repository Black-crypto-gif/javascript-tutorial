## JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript has several data types, including:

### 1. Number

The `number` data type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Numbers can be created using numeric literals or by calling the `Number()` constructor.

### 2. String

The `string` data type represents a sequence of characters. Strings can be created using string literals or by calling the `String()` constructor.

### 3. Boolean

The `boolean` data type represents a logical value that can be either `true` or `false`.

### 4. Null

The `null` data type represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a special value that represents nothing, empty, or unknown.

### 5. Undefined

The `undefined` data type represents a variable that has not been assigned a value. It is also used as the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return a value.

### 6. Symbol

The `symbol` data type represents a unique identifier that can be used to avoid naming conflicts. Symbols are created using the `Symbol()` constructor.

### 7. Object

The `object` data type represents a collection of properties and values. Objects can be created using object literals or by calling constructor functions.

JavaScript also has a special type called `NaN`, which stands for "Not a Number". It is returned when a mathematical operation fails, such as dividing by zero or converting a string to a number that is not a valid number.

Understanding JavaScript data types is essential for writing efficient and effective code. Knowing when and how to use each data type can help you avoid common pitfalls and make your code more robust.
