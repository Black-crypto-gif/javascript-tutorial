## Objects

JavaScript obj

## Iterators

JavaScript iterators are objects that provide a way to traverse sequences of data, such as arrays or strings. Iterators allow for more efficient and flexible handling of data.

## Callback functions

JavaScript callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when a specific event occurs. Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous code and event handling.

## Regular expressions

JavaScript regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to search, replace, and validate strings.

## error-handling-try-catch

JavaScript error handling using try/catch is a way to handle errors and exceptions in a more controlled and predictable manner. Code inside a try block is executed, and if an error occurs, the catch block handles the error.

## Higher-order functions

JavaScript higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result. Higher-order functions are a powerful tool for creating reusable and composable code.

## Closures

JavaScript closures are functions that have access to variables outside of their own scope. Closures are useful for creating private variables and functions and for implementing callback functions.

## Event handling

JavaScript event handling is a way to respond to user actions or other events in a web page or application. Events can be captured and handled using event listeners and callback functions.

## Conclusion

This tutorial covers the basics of JavaScript, including variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and objects. By mastering these concepts, you'll be able to create dynamic and interactive web applications. Happy coding!
